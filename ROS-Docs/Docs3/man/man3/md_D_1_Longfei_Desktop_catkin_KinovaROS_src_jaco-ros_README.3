The \fCjaco-ros\fP module provides a ROS interface for the Kinova Robotics JACO, JACO2 (see limitations) and MICO robotic manipulator arms\&. This module exposes the Kinova C++ hardware API through ROS\&. This documentation will usually refer to the JACO arm, but the instructions work with both the JACO and the MICO unless otherwise noted\&.

.SS "Overview"
.PP
The JACO API is exposed to ROS using a combination of actionlib (for sending trajectory commands to the arm), services (for instant control such as homing the arm or e-stop) and published topics (joint feedback)\&. The Arm may be commanded using either angular commands or Cartesian co-ordinates\&.
.PP
In addition, two techniques are available to visualize the model in your ROS environment\&. The custom transform publisher of previous releases is still available, along with a URDF-based approach using the JointStates output and robot_state_publisher\&.
.PP
There are three actionlib modules available: \fCarm_pose/arm_pose\fP, \fCjoint_angles/arm_joint_angles\fP, and \fCfingers/finger_position\fP\&. These server modules accept coordinates which are passed on to the Kinova JACO API for controlling the arm\&.
.PP
The services available are: \fCin/home_arm\fP, \fCin/stop\fP, and \fCin/start\fP\&. These services require no input goals, and are intended for quick control of basic arm functions\&. When called, home_arm will halt all other movement and return the arm to its 'home' position\&. The stop service is a software e-stop, which instantly stops the arm and prevents any further movement until the start service is called\&.
.PP
Published topics are: \fCout/cartesian_velocity, out/joint_velocity, out/finger_position, out/joint_angles, out/joint_state\fP, \fCout/tool_position\fP, and \fCout/tool_wrench\fP for robots with torque sensors\&. The \fCcartesian_velocity\fP and \fCjoint_velocity\fP are both subscribers which may be used to set the joint velocity of the arm\&. The \fCfinger_position\fP and \fCjoint_angles\fP topics publish the raw angular position of the fingers and joints, respectively, in degrees\&. The \fCjoint_state\fP topic publishes via \fCsensor_msgs\fP the transformed joint angles in radians\&. The \fCtool_position\fP topic publishes the Cartesian co-ordinates of the arm and end effector via \fCgeometry_msgs\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "JACO-ROS Module Architecture"
.PP
The \fCjaco_arm_driver\fP node acts as an interface between the Kinova JACO C++ API and the various actionservers, message services and topics used to interface with the arm\&.
.PP
The \fCjaco_tf_updater\fP node subscribes to the jaco_arm_driver node to obtain current joint angle information from the node\&. It then publishes a transform which may be used in visualization programs such as rviz\&. This node is now optional and kept for compatibility issues\&. The URDF-based approach is now preferred\&.
.PP
.SS "Cartesian Control"
.PP
Cartesian control is accomplished via actionserver\&. The Cartesian co-ordinates are published as a separate topic\&. The arm has a maximum reach of about 0\&.9m (90cm), so the 'position' range is about +/-0\&.9 for all three dimensions\&. The three wrist joints are capable of continuous rotation, and therefore capable of being commanded up to +/-174\&.5 rad\&. You may want to limit to +/-6\&.28 rad in software to prevent the joints from rotating excessively\&.

.PP
.SS "Launch files"
.PP
The \fBjaco_driver\fP package provides two launch files, depending on which robot you want to control\&. The jaco_arm\&.launch and mico_arm\&.launch files should be run prior to using the JACO (or MICO) arm\&. It launches the main driver node, \fCjaco_arm_driver\fP, and \fCjaco_tf_updater\fP in classic, non-URDF mode (see next section)\&. These nodes then perform a number of operations that prepare the arm for use\&.
.PP
On launch, the \fCjaco_arm_driver\fP announces all of the configurations stored in the arm’s permanent memory\&. These are settings that, currently, are most easily set using the Windows-only Kinova GUI\&. The fingers may move during initialization, but the arm is not automatically homed\&. If the arm does not respond after initialization, it may need to be homed\&.
.PP
.SS "URDF mode"
.PP
To enable URDF-based transform publication, set the 'use_urdf' launch file parameter to 'true'\&. This can be done from the command line: 
.PP
.nf
roslaunch jaco_arm_driver [jaco|mico]_arm.launch use_urdf:=true

.fi
.PP
.PP
NOTE: The URDF model for the JACO2 arm will be available soon\&.
.PP
.SS "Custom transform publisher (classic and default) mode"
.PP
The \fCjaco_tf_updater\fP begins publishing transform data as soon as it becomes available from the \fCjaco_arm_driver node\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "Installation"
.PP
To make ros-jaco part of your workspace, follow these steps (assuming your workspace is setup following the standard conventions): 
.PP
.nf
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/jaco-ros.git jaco-ros
cd ~/catkin
catkin_make

.fi
.PP
.PP
To access the arm via usb copy the udev rule file \fC99-jaco-arm\&.rules\fP from \fC<your_workspace>/ros-jaco-arm/jaco_driver/udev\fP to \fC/etc/udev/rules\&.d/\fP: 
.PP
.nf
sudo cp jaco_driver/udev/99-jaco-arm.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

.fi
.PP
.PP
If you would like the \fCjaco_arm_driver\fP and \fCjaco_tf_updater nodes\fP to launch automatically when ROS is started, copy the \fCjaco_arm\&.launch\fP file contained in the \fC/launch\fP folder into the relevant \fC/core\&.d\fP folder\&.
.PP
.SS "Using Multiple Arms"
.PP
This version of \fCjaco-ros\fP supports multiple arms\&. In order to use multiple arms you must set the the \fCserial_number\fP parameter for that arm and a \fCtf_prefix\fP for both the \fCarm_driver\fP node and the \fCtf_updater\fP node\&. For example, include the following lines in the launch file between \fC<node pkg='jaco_driver' type='jaco_arm_driver' \&.\&.\&.>\fP and \fC</node>\fP: 
.PP
.nf
<param name="serial_number" value="PJ00123456789012345" />
<param name="arm_pose/tf_prefix" value="jaco_" />

.fi
.PP
.PP
And the following line in the launch file between \fC<node pkg='jaco_driver' type='jaco_tf_updater' \&.\&.\&.>\fP and \fC</node>\fP: 
.PP
.nf
<param name="tf_prefix" value="jaco_" />

.fi
.PP
.PP
If no serial number parameter is set, the node will simply try to connect to the JACO or MICO arm that is present\&. In some cases the serial number may not be set in the arm; simply set the serial number parameter to '0\&.'
.PP
.SS "Execution"
.PP
This package has been tested in Ubuntu 12\&.04 LTS with ROS Hydro\&. The 5\&.01\&.01 driver/API is included in the package; however, you should ensure that the firmware on the arm is up-to-date\&. Using old versions of the firmware may result in unexpected behavior\&.

.SS "Known Limitations"
.PP
.IP "1." 4
Partial support of the JACO2 arm\&. Control and raw state is available, but the will be available later this month\&. For now, the default 'jaco_arm\&.launch' file can be used, but the visualization or arm (or forward kinematics in URDF mode) will not be valid\&.
.IP "2." 4
The \fCjoint_state\fP topic currently reports only the arm position and velocity\&. Effort is a placeholder for future compatibility\&. Depending on your firmware version velocity values can be wrong\&. The behavior of the angle velocity conversion can be changed with the 'convert_joint_velocities' parameter of jaco_arm_driver\&.
.IP "3." 4
When updating the firmware on the arm (e\&.g\&., using Jacosoft) the serial number will be set to 'Not set' which will cause multiple arms to be unusable\&. The solution is to make sure that the serial number is reset after updating the arm firmware\&.
.IP "4." 4
After using angular control, the arm may not respond to Cartesian commands (e\&.g\&., arm_pose or figer_position) until the arm has been homed\&.
.IP "5." 4
Some virtualization software products are known to work well with this package, while others do not\&. The issue appears to be related to proper handover of access to the USB port to the API\&. Parallels and VMWare are able to do this properly, while VirtualBox causes the API to fail with a '1015' error\&.
.IP "6." 4
With the latest firmware, the JACO arm will sag slightly when gripper commands are sent\&. This behavior has not been observed with the MICO arm\&.
.IP "7." 4
Previously, files under \fCjaco-ros/jaco_driver/lib/i386-linux-gnu\fP had a bug which required uses 32-bit systems to manually copy them into devel or install to work\&. This package has not been tested with 32-bit systems and this workaround may still be required\&. 64-bit versions seem to be unaffected\&.
.IP "8." 4
In certain cases, while commanding the MICO arm using angular commands, the force limits may be exceeded and the arm will stop\&. If this occurs, consider increasing the force limits of your arm using JacoSoft, or use shorter movements that put less stress on the arm joints\&.
